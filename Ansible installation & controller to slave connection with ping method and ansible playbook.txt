sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo hostname parent (Hostname is nothing but changing the name for example:-[ip address:- 32.098.18.31 to nani])
sudo apt install ansible
ansible --version
ssh-keygen
vi hosts inside we have to paste [slave private ip addresses and create a group name]

when u have generated keygen get into cd .ssh/ and use command as [cat id.pub] file and copy the key and paste it in slave server of cd .ssh/ in authorized keys

Then, ansible -i hosts rahul -m ping

ansible -i <-i is nothing but inventory> hosts is nothing but a group name -m is module.

after create a yml file <name.yml> inside that write a playbook regarding nginx

---
- hosts: rahul
  tasks:
    - name: install nginx
      apt: name=nginx state=latest
    - name: start nginx
      service:
          name: nginx
          state: started

This is [playbook] Now we can use the command to run nginx playbook 

Ansible-playbook -i hosts <yml file name> -b 

-b is nothing but giving yes to run the playbook [playbook is nothing but the script which we have written in the yml file]
